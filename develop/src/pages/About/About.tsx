              <p>
                I Graduated from the Novosibirsk State Technical University. I like reading,
                cooking, walking in the city, yoga-practice and living in a warm climate. All my
                joblife I working with deadlines, numbers, documents and people. The development
                process is like magic for me, when life appears on a blank slate: colors, shapes,
                interactivity, statistics. Now I grown up to Front-end developer, and I&apos;m not
                going to stop there

              <p>
                Hello, I&apos;m Maxim and I&apos;ve been purposefully learning the craft of creating
                web applications for about a year now. Just recently I turned 21, I managed to
                complete my studies in Belarus as a mechanical engineering technologist, but this
                was not where I saw myself, now I am looking for myself in the field of information
                technology and trying to settle down in a new country. I love beautiful interfaces,
                historical and philosophical literature, heavy music and long walks in the forest.
              </p>

                My name is Michael and I live in the Grodno-city, Republic of Belarus. I graduated
                from the Belarusian National Technical University, faculty &quot;Electric power
                systems and networks&quot;. I like progress, all sorts of smart things and of course
                computers . I started learning frontend development 2 years ago, and I really like
                it, especially when I have to think through and write logic, this is probably my
                favorite. At the moment I&apos;m finishing stage#2, it wasn&apos;t easy, but I got
                through with it, and I&apos;m not going to stop.
